# Music Player Project
 ## Overview
This project involves building a music player application using React, integrating with the Spotify API to fetch and display music data. The application features various components such as a sidebar for navigation, a player with controls, and a queue for managing playlists.

# Components
1. # Sidebar Component
The sidebar lists all the pages available on the website.
It uses React Router for navigation between different pages.
2. # Player Component
* Progress Bar: Created using SVGs from scratch.
* Controls and Info Section:
* Play Button: Designed in Figma, with a Neumorphic design.
* Song Info: Includes album image with a glassy shadow effect, and animated text displaying song information.
3. # Queue Component
Displays the queue of songs with a CSS background pattern (no images used).
Allows interaction with the song queue, like adding songs to the playlist.
4. # Extras Component
Contains sections like "Similar Artists", "Made for You", and "New Releases".
Features a glassmorphism effect and hover animations

# Integrations
## Spotify API
* Connects to the Spotify API to fetch data such as playlists and song information.
* Displays user-specific playlists and allows interaction with them.

# Development Process

1. ## Creating Components
  * Start by defining the project structure and creating the necessary components in React.
  * Implement React Router for navigating between different components.

2. ## Styling with CSS
  * Use CSS for styling components, creating effects like glassmorphism and animations.
  * Utilize Figma for designing UI elements and extracting CSS for use in the project.

3. ## SVG Progress Bar
  * Create a custom progress bar using SVGs.
  * Implement animations and interactions for the progress bar.

4. ## API Integration
  * Integrate the Spotify API to fetch and display data.
  * Handle API requests and manage state within the React app.


## Conclusion

By following this documentation, you will learn how to:

* Set up a React app and structure it properly.
* Create and style components using CSS and SVGs.
* Integrate and use the Spotify API.
* Implement routing in a React app and manage state effectively.
* This project not only builds a functional music player but also enhances your skills in React, CSS, and API integrations.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
